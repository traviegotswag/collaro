# Custom-shirt by Collaro 

This app allows users to create a user profile with Collaro before they make a purchase. Users simply need to answer a list of 10 questions for Collaro to generate their unique size for their custom shirt. And if the wish to make minor adjustments to their preferences or their shirt measurements, they can do it anytime, anywhere. 

With their measurements stored in Collaro's database, they can proceed to purchase their custom-shirt which they will receive between 1 to 2 weeks. 


### Description
If a user goes to the root route `/` they see all the tweets.

Users can register and/or login in order to create a tweet.

#### Getting Started
Create each part of your app step by step.

1. Create a tebles.sql for your app. Don't worry too much about making it complete, since with a seed.sql file you can update your db easily.

  1.5 The basic tables.sql will have a users table and a tweets table- notice that the starter code provided wants a name and password column in the database.

  1.6 The app provides a basic user creation, so the basic app doesn't nee d anything more for users.

2. Implement login of the user. ( change the code to a hashed session cookie, instead of just `loggedin=true`.

3. Create the ability to make a tweet.

4. Change the root route to display all tweets.
